# Fake-Profile-Detection
The Fake Profile Detection project is designed to identify and eliminate fraudulent accounts on social media platforms and online services. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and natural language processing (NLP), the system analyzes various aspects of a profile, including account information, user behavior, and content authenticity. Data collection and preprocessing are key steps in this project, ensuring that the system works with clean, structured data. Feature extraction focuses on identifying important indicators such as profile completeness, engagement metrics, and language patterns. The project implements supervised learning models like Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify profiles as either genuine or fake. Additionally, NLP techniques are employed to scrutinize text content for signs of automation or deceptive intent, while behavioral analysis looks at user activity patterns, such as posting frequency and interaction history. The system's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with model fine-tuning conducted to enhance detection rates. Ultimately, the project provides an effective solution for maintaining the integrity of online communities by accurately identifying and removing fake profiles.
